<p><strong>These are our favorite colors</strong></p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>This little project came to life out of my love of color and curiosity. I think it’s also a simple project for people like me who are still learning and  want to exercise with making a pull request.</p>
<p>The idea is just to display people’s favorite color and see what the result will look like.</p>
<p>Check the website to find out.</p>
<p>And be welcome to add your own favorite one too. I’d love to see which color you chose!</p>
<h3>How to contribute</h3>
<p>In the index.html file, copy a ‘div’ code block that has a class=”colorblock” and paste it right underneath the last one, right before the closing ‘main’ tag.
Between the ‘span’ tags, fill in your name, followed by a space and the hex color code of your favorite color. Your name and the color code will then appear as a tooltip when you hover the color block. Also fill in the hex code of your favorite color in the style=”background-color:yourfavoritecolor” attribute.

<p>Make a pull request so that your color can be added to the website. Follow these steps:</p>
<ul><li>Fork this repository.</li>
<li>Clone your GitHub fork to your computer. Make sure you are in the directory you want your forked repository to be cloned in.</li>

<li>Push back to your forked repository.</li>
<li>Click the 'compare & pull request' button.</li>

<p>And that’s it. Thanks!</p>
