# Our favorite colors
<p><strong>These are our favorite colors</strong></p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>This little project came to life from my love of color and curiosity. I think it’s also a simple project for people who, like me, are still learning and want to exercise by making a pull request.</p>
<p>The idea is just to display people’s favorite color and see what the result will look like. A future addition to the project will be that the colors will be able to be filtered based on gender.</p>
<p>Checkout <a href="https://ourfavoritecolors.vercel.app/" target="_blank">the website</a> to find out what colors we like.</p>
<p>And be welcome to add your own favorite one too. I’d love to see which color you chose!</p>
<h3>How to contribute</h3>
<p>In the index.html file, copy an &lt;a&gt; code block and paste it underneath the last one, right before the closing &lt;main&gt; tag. Add your gender to the class="colorblock", for instance class="colorblock female". Between the &lt;span&gt; tags, fill in your name, followed by a space and the hex color code of the color you chose. Your name and the color code will then appear as a tooltip when you hover or click the color block. Also fill in the hex code of your favorite color in the style=”background-color:yourfavoritecolor” attribute.</p>
<p><a href="https://coolors.co/e6544f" target="_blank">This</a> is a great tool to pick your color.</p>
